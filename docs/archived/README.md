## Why These Were Archived

1. **Reduced Maintenance Burden**: Fewer files mean less to keep updated
2. **Improved Discoverability**: Consolidated guides are easier to find and navigate
3. **Better Organization**: Related information is now grouped together
4. **Eliminated Duplication**: Multiple documents covering the same topics caused confusion
5. **Historical Context**: Original documents preserved for reference

## When to Use Archived Documents

You might want to reference these archived documents if:

- You need detailed historical context about a specific fix or change
- You're investigating when/why a particular change was made
- You want to understand the evolution of the project architecture
- You need very specific technical details that were condensed in the consolidated guides

For all other cases, use the current documentation in the root directory.
